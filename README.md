# Practice CTF Writeups

My name is Ruby, and I am very new to CTFs. I want to get better at them... a lot better. 
I think the best way to master what I know is to reflect on the challenges that I have completed.

I am going to be posting the writeups that I do on this Github repo as a way to practice communicating what I learn to others during my time doing CTFs. 
I don't expect anyone to really look at these. These are just for practice, but eventually I hope to get good enough at these that I can break the things I learn down enough that even my friends who know nothing about competitive cyber could understand what I am doing.

Thank you for checking out these writeups and I hope you learn something from my practice.
